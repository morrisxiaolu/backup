	 README: Broadcom sb1250e

This file contains board-specific information for the Broadcom
bcm1250 platform board.  This file documents BSP interface changes 
from previous software or hardware versions, and notifies the user 
of serious caveats that must be noted before using this BSP.  
Additionally, the target board's manual page entry (e.g., man sb1250e)
provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks.  The 
target manual page should be read fully before this BSP is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RELEASE 2.0/10

	Released from Wind River for VxWorks 6.6.

	Added support for vxBus interrupt controllers

	Interrupt configuration and control, sbe end driver and serial
	drivers moved to vxBus.  Files deleted from BSP no longer
	required with this change.

RELEASE 2.0/9

	Released from Wind River for VxWorks 6.5.

	Integrated with the IPNet Network Stack.
	Fixed SPR WIND00067150 - sb1xxx fails nvRam test

RELEASE 2.0/7

	Added CFE integration and BCM91480b bsp support.

RELEASE 2.0/6

	Released from Wind River for Workbench 2.0, VxWorks 6.3.

	Add definition of 'Bsp' to local cdf. There are no longer separate BSPs
	required for building scalable and non-scalable kernels. This BSP can
	be used for either. It supports the scaled-down kernel PROFILES.

	Sundry SPR fixes applied.

RELEASE 2.0/5

        Added support for scalability.

RELEASE 2.0/4

        Released from Wind River for Workbench 2.0, VxWorks 6.0.

        Add virtual memory management support. Clean-up various compiler
        warnings.

RELEASE 1.2/3

        Reorganized the common code and added conditional compiles to facilitate
        code sharing and reuse between the Swarm and Sentosa target BSPs.

        Modified the nvRAM interface to support the 24lc128 EEPROM on the later
        Swarm target hardware. Also fixed a timeout problem in the x1240 EEPROM
        driver which was causing the processor to appear to hang on targets
        lacking the x1240 chip [SPR 83073].

        Fixed the CPU_CLOCK_RATE, its #define was missing a '0' [SPR 81403].

RELEASE 1.2/2

        Released from Wind River for Tornado 2.2, VxWorks 5.5.

        The L2 cache is now enabled (requires reflash of bootrom to take 
        effect). The sbe END driver has been improved and moved from the
        BSP to the Wind River standard drivers library. The x1240 EEPROM
        driver has been modified to handle binary data parameters. Corrected
        the ROM_SIZE parameter to properly reflect the 2 MB flash size. Changed
        sysClk source from on-chip timer to R4k count/compare. Moved auxClk
        from on-chip timer 1/3 to 0/1. Added timestamp support with the R4k
        timer library. Reserved INT5 from the bcm1250IntLib handler. 

RELEASE 1.2/1

	Released from Wind River for Tornado 2.1.2, VxWorks 5.4 and
	Tornado 2.2 BETA, VxWorks 5.5.

        Relocated the SM anchor address from KSEG1 to KSEG0.  Increased the 
	SYS_CLK_RATE_MAX to 5000. Made the conditional compile code for 
	selecting the object loader type in the sysBootSec routine to 
	unconditionally use the ELF loader

RELEASE 1.2/0

	Released from Wind River for Tornado 2.1, VxWorks 5.4 and Tornado
	2.2, VxWorks 5.5
